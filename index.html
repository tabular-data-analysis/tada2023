							<h2>Objectives</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis">Data Analysis</a> is described as the
							process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of
							discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-
							making. Performing such tasks over large and heterogeneous
							collections of tabular data, as found in <b>enterprise data lakes</b> and <b>on
								the Web</b>, is extremely challenging and an attractive research topic
							in data management, AI, and related communities. The goal of this workshop is to bring
							together researchers and practitioners in these diverse communities that work on
							addressing the fundamental research challenges of tabular data analysis and
							building automated solutions in this space
						</p>
						<p>
							We aim to provide a forum for: a) exchange of ideas between two communities: 1) an active
							community of data management researchers working on data integration and schema and data
							matching problems over tabular data, and 2) a vibrant community of researchers in AI and
							Semantic Web communities working on the core challenge of matching tabular data to Knowledge
							Graphs as a part of the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/">ISWC
								SemTab Challenges</a>.
							b) presentation of late-breaking results related to several emerging research areas such as
							table representation learning and its applications, automation of data science pipelines,
							and data lake and data lakehouse solutions.
							c) discussion of real-world data management challenges related to implementing industrial
							scale tabular data anaylsis solutions.

						Keynote by <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/people/alon-halevy/"><b>Alon Halevey, Meta AI</b></a> <br>
						Title: <b>Personal Digital Data: Where LLMs Meet Structured Data</b><br>
						<b>Abstract:</b> The important question of how companies and organizations use our data has
						received a lot of attention in the technology and policy communities. An equally important
						question that deserves more focus going forward is how we, as individuals, can take advantage of
						the data we generate to improve our health, vitality, and productivity and our overall well-being.
						We create a variety of data throughout our days, including our photos, workout stats, locations we’ve been
						to, the stuff we buy online and the content we consume. Fusing all this data together enables us to build a
						fascinating timeline of our lives. To leverage these timelines in order to help us produce new satisfying
						experiences we need to be able to query our timelines in natural language and to share short summaries of
						it with external services.  <br><br>

						This talk will start by motivating the work on fusing personal digital data including its potential pitfalls.
						I will then discuss multiple approaches to the problem of querying timelines, which is an application area that
						forces us to consider deeply how language models can be used to query data that is partially structured and partially not.
