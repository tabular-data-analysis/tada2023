							<h2>Objectives</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis">Data Analysis</a> is described as the
							process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of
							discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-
							making. Performing such tasks over large and heterogeneous
							collections of tabular data, as found in <b>enterprise data lakes</b> and <b>on
								the Web</b>, is extremely challenging and an attractive research topic
							in data management, AI, and related communities. The goal of this workshop is to bring
							together researchers and practitioners in these diverse communities that work on
							addressing the fundamental research challenges of tabular data analysis and
							building automated solutions in this space
						</p>
						<p>
							We aim to provide a forum for: a) exchange of ideas between two communities: 1) an active
							community of data management researchers working on data integration and schema and data
							matching problems over tabular data, and 2) a vibrant community of researchers in AI and
							Semantic Web communities working on the core challenge of matching tabular data to Knowledge
							Graphs as a part of the <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/challenges/sem-tab/">ISWC
								SemTab Challenges</a>.
							b) presentation of late-breaking results related to several emerging research areas such as
							table representation learning and its applications, automation of data science pipelines,
							and data lake and data lakehouse solutions.
							c) discussion of real-world data management challenges related to implementing industrial
							scale tabular data anaylsis solutions.

						Keynote by <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/renee-miller/"><b>Renée Miller,
								Northeastern University</b></a> <br>
						Title: <b>From Discovery to Integration of Data Lake Tables</b><br>
						Abstract: We have made tremendous strides in providing tools for data scientists to discover new
						tables that are useful for their analyses. But despite these advances, the proper integration of
						discovered tables has been under-explored. An interesting semantics for integration, called full
						disjunction, was proposed in the 1990’s, but there has been little progress in using it for data
						science to integrate tables culled from data lakes. In this talk, I will overview both ALITE, a
						method to integrate (possibly incomplete) tables using a new scalable implementation of full
						disjunction, and DIALITE, an open discovery system that lets users discover, integrate, then
						analyze a set of tables using discovery methods such as Starmie, a new table union search
						method. To evaluate our systems, we developed and shared three new benchmarks for integration
						that use real data lake tables. I will present open problems and challenges in developing and
						evaluating scalable table search and integration methods on real data. <br><br>

						The ALITE [1] work was led by Aamod Khatiwada in collaboration with Professors Roee Shraga of
						the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Renée Miller, and Wolfgang Gatterbauer of Northeastern
						University in Boston. DIALTE [2} was also led by Aamod Khatiwada in collaboration with
						Professors Roee Shraga and Renée Miller.
						Starmie [3] was led by Grace Fan in collaboration with Megagon Labs researchers Jin Wang,
						Yuliang Li and Dan Zhang.

						Keynote by <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/people/alon-halevy/"><b>Alon Halevey, Meta
								AI</b></a> <br>
						Title: <b>Personal Digital Data: Where LLMs Meet Structured Data</b><br>
						Abstract: The important question of how companies and organizations use our data has
						received a lot of attention in the technology and policy communities. An equally important
						question that deserves more focus going forward is how we, as individuals, can take advantage of
						the data we generate to improve our health, vitality, and productivity and our overall
						well-being.
						We create a variety of data throughout our days, including our photos, workout stats, locations
						we’ve been
						to, the stuff we buy online and the content we consume. Fusing all this data together enables us
						to build a
						fascinating timeline of our lives. To leverage these timelines in order to help us produce new
						satisfying
						experiences we need to be able to query our timelines in natural language and to share short
						summaries of
						it with external services. <br><br>

						This talk will start by motivating the work on fusing personal digital data including its
						potential pitfalls.
						I will then discuss multiple approaches to the problem of querying timelines, which is an
						application area that
						forces us to consider deeply how language models can be used to query data that is partially
						structured and partially not.
